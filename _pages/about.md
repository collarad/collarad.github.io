I am a Senior Research Engineer specialized in the conceptualization, design, and development of Enterprise Information Systems using state-of-the-art technologies, such as Deep Learning, Knowledge Graphs, and Linked Data. 
My master degree in the area of Software Engineering gave me a solid knowledge in Project Management, Software Architecture and Design, Software Development, and User Experience. 
My Ph.D. gives me enough expertise to solve complex problems in enterprises such as big data integration and analysis, semantic search, question answering and dialog systems, plus knowledge graphs creation and exploitation.

I am a Senior Research Engineer specialized in the conceptualization, design, and development of Enterprise Information Systems using state-of-the-art technologies, such as Deep Learning, Knowledge Graphs, and Linked Data. 
My master's degree in the area of Software Engineering gave me a sound knowledge in Project Management, Software Architecture and Design, Software Development, and User Experience. 
My Ph.D. gives me enough expertise to solve complex problems in enterprises, including big data integration and analysis, semantic search, question answering, and dialog systems, plus knowledge graphs creation and exploitation.
Java, Scala, Python, Tensorflow, Pytorch, and Play Framework specialist
Strong communication skills in English, Spanish, French, and German.
I am a natural team player.
